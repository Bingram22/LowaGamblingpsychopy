**Author**: Chengran

**Date created**: November 14, 2020 

This experiment was based on the decision making task of Wemm and Wulfert's (2017) [^1] research, which is a replication of Bechara and colleagues' (1994) [^2] original paper on LGT. This experiment has 100 trials. The schedule of card as stated by Shurman and colleagues (2017) [^3]: 

>  In deck A, the penalties are frequent and range from 100 to ​350, while in deck B the penalties are infrequent but of larger magnitude (1250). By picking preferentially from decks A and B, subjects will incur a net loss over time. In deck C the penalties are frequent and range from 25 to 75, while in deck D the penalties are infrequent but of larger magnitude ($250). By picking preferentially from decks C and D, a subject will incur a net gain over time. 





Note: This experiment was build on a virtual machine of ***Windows 10*** under ***macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7***. The version of ***Psychopy*** is 2020.1.3.
